                I need to change my hand so it doesn't have fingers on the side and the front.
                This would make it so my character had 5 fingers on each of his finger which is not 
                good. I also need to change his feet on the side view because I think it looks to
                short in comparison to the rest of his body.

            I changed the board so that it wouldn't have the outlines that it had before. Now it should have no borders so the people can understand it easier.

                  I need to change the length of my arms due to them looking small and off proption when next to the torso.
                  I will do this by increasing the length and width of the upper and lower arm until it looks in proportion next to the torso.

              I improved the shoulder to make it look more rounded at the top and more natural. The other change that I made was the size of the arms. 
              I changed the scale to make it look more in proportion and not look weird. Now the 3D character looks a lot better without too much change.

                  I think that my characters feet look too big and square. I want to make them more angled so it's bigger 
                  on one side then the other and lower by the toes so it looks like a normal human foot.

              I improved the shape of my characters feet so they look natural and more like an actual foot shape without adding extra faces or vertices.
              The other thing I changed was the crotch area so that it was even and looked more natural. Now my characterslegs look good and can be attached to the torso.
