                I need to change my hand so it doesn't have fingers on the side and the front.
                This would make it so my character had 5 fingers on each of his finger which is not 
                good. I also need to change his feet on the side view because I think it looks to
                short in comparison to the rest of his body.

            I changed the board so that it wouldn't have the outlines that it had before. Now it should have no borders so the people can understand it easier.

                  I need to change the length of my arms due to them looking small and off proption when next to the torso.
                  I will do this by increasing the length and width of the upper and lower arm until it looks in proportion next to the torso.

              I improved the function by adding statements that made the function work when O wins since it didn't work earlier due to it not returning a value. As well as that I fixed the singleplayer working when someone wins by making name2
              called computer so I wouldn't have to make a singleplayer version of the function. This worked and now the singleplayer function works with the win/lose function.
