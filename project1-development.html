                I need to change my hand so it doesn't have fingers on the side and the front.
                This would make it so my character had 5 fingers on each of his finger which is not 
                good. I also need to change his feet on the side view because I think it looks to
                short in comparison to the rest of his body.

            I changed the legs and the stance so it looks more natuaral they look more like a normal person. 
            I changed his hands from having finger to only have a thumb and a massive finger. I did this because
            I don't need the fingers since I'm not modeling him holding something really specific. I added another arm
            since I changed his arm length and couldn't <!-- Continue and rescan the image -->
