          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This website displays the projects I created in year 11 at Western Springs. This project is a low poly 
            character and some animations for it. This includes the Devlopment, Implications, End Users and Requirements. 
            I created this project using this tool:

            This project is targeted towards a employer that needs 3D character models created for a video game or other project.
            They would look at this work to see what I have done and how I could help them create models. They will need to see
            that I can create a good 3D character and that I'm able make animations. Game developers might also want to use 
            the model and animations I have made for their game. My target is countries that speak English. Employers might want
            to know what software I used and what skills were used in the creation of my character and animations.
