            Our game is Tic Tac Toe and we have decided to attempt to make a multiplayer, and singleplayer mode. It will make a visual board and let them take turns with their moves.
            It will tell you if you win or lose, and let them retry making it replayable and fun. <br> <br> We used:

            This project is targeted towards someone who wants to play Tic Tac Toe and has time to do so. The best group of people to target with 
            a Tic Tac Toe game is kids, this is due to them having lots of spare time, friends to play with, and they want to play easy and quick games.
            We will make instructions to explain the game to kids who would want to play it and make sure they would be able to understand it. For replayability
            we will add a score system and changing who starts so they can play multiple times with friends easily.
